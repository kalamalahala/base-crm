        <h4>I already have insurance.</h4>

        <p class="lead">Awesome, the good news about this policy is that it doesn't compete with any existing coverage.
            In fact, it pays in addition to what you already have. I promised <span class="referral-text lead-referred-by">(referrer)</span>
            that I would make sure you got yours, so What time are you and your spouse home from work tomorrow? <span class="script-reminder">(find out if they have plans or post-work routines)</span></p>

        <h4>I would like to talk to the one who sponsored me.</h4>

        <p class="lead">I can definitely understand that!!! While you do that let me go ahead and send you a soft invite.
            What this does is temporarily secures your appointment time. Because we help so many families we work by appointment only, and I don't want you to miss out.
            The invite will expire at 9 pm tonight if you don't confirm by then. So please respond to the invite once you speak with <span class="referral-text lead-referred-by">(referrer)</span>. <span class="lead-first-name">[client name]</span> Potentially what time will work best for you tomorrow? <span class="script-reminder">(find out if they have plans or post-work routines)</span>

        <h4>$3,000 isn't enough.</h4>

        <p class="lead">While that may be true for your situation, the policy doesn't cost you anything. Because we help so many families we work by appointment only, and I don't want you to miss out so What time are you and your spouse home from work tomorrow? <span class="script-reminder">(find out if they have plans or post-work routines)</span></p>

        <h4>I'm not interested.</h4>

        <p class="lead"><span class="lead-first-name">[client name]</span>, Your policy has already been activated, it's simply my job to go over how it works, collect your beneficiaries and explain everything that you're entitled to as well, so What time are you and your spouse home from work tomorrow? <span class="script-reminder">(find out if they have plans or post-work routines)</span></p>

        <h4>Advanced agent I'm not interested</h4>

        <p class="lead"><span class="lead-first-name">[client name]</span>, if I were a telemarketer that would make sense. __________ thought that this policy would be ideal for you (and your family). Again, there is no cost for the policy and it won't take long to get you set up, so what time will you be home from work tomorrow?</p>

        <p class="lead">(if still not interested): <span class="lead-first-name">[client name]</span> our company is determined to bless as many families as possible, but that only happens through referrals. Since you're forfeiting your policy is there anyone that you know that can benefit from having family protection at no cost?</p>
